# Relationship-based Dialogue System

## Purpose

This is essentially a relationship system for RPGs to be extended to a dialogue system. Instead of the traditional 1-dimensional relatioship system of NPCs liking you a little more or a little less, the idea is to use a multi-dimensional system for each NPC abstracting how they _percieve_ the player. Each dialogue option will then shift one or multiple of these values. The player is then evaluated by the NPC according to how they value the qualities or lack thereof by the player. This enables dialogue options to be reevaluated over time instead of having an immediate, short-term impact on the relationship.

## Why?

The traditional system is extremely short-term. Choices are either good or bad for the relationship. This not only leads to ass kissing NPCs the player likes (and therefore compromises roleplaying) but leaves no room for dialogue options having long-term impact, unless tediously implemented. This system intends to solve this problem by frontloading the complexity into the mechanics of the system while leaving the mechanics virtually unchanged and easy to use while making the writing process of dialogue not necessarily more complicated and, in some cases, even simplifying it.

## How?

Like mentioned above, NPCs' opinions of the player will depend on multiple values instead of only one. This enables long-term relationship building and actual, meaningful character developments. Dialogue options will affect one or more of these values and will be saved to memory. Short-term effects of dialogue options will be handled mostly outside of the mechanics; a character might react positively or negatively in the way they express themselves through dialogue or may decide to engange or disengange with immediate problems, though this does not necessarily mean the choice will have the same effect long-term. This enables dialogue choices to have different long- and short-term consequences depending on if the 'reason' behind the choice ligns up with the NPC's own values.

## So how would this exactly look?

The exact dimensions will depend on the thems of the game. Possible dimensions are:

- Sincerity/Incerity
- Reliability/Unreliabilty
- Selflessness/Selfishness
- Politeness/Rudeness

### Example

The NPC is a member of an order of knights he was conscripted into at a young age. First, he hated it, then they gave him purpose and became his new family. Now, this order performs some questionable intoxications rituals with their members (the in-universe reason for that does not matter for this example).

If the player critizises the order for this practice, it only makes sense for the NPC to react negatively at first. His identity has just been put to question. In a 1-dimensional system this would mean losing points, damaging the relationship. In this proposed system, the character will still react negatively, maybe even leave the party/the player's presence for a while and lose scores on the Politeness and Reliability scales. Should the player consistently prove to be sincere, selfless, and reliable (making ameds for the points lost prior), which are values of the NPC, he might reconsider his first reaction to the comment. This might occur hours later in the game, but as (important) dialogue choices are remembered and the NPC's opinion of the player has changed since then, he now sees the comment no longer as insulting but as a sincere effort to be helpful. Now, the NPC might actually decide to confront the order's leaders about their practices or even desert, all based on the dialogue choice made and the roleplaying effort made by the player.

Of course there is gonna be, Stefe.
